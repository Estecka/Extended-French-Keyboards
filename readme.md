# Extended French Keyboards

This is a collections of customized keyboard layouts, derived from the French Azerty layout, but with some added functionalities for my Gamer/Writer/Developper needs.

The source files and binaries were generated using [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).

### Layouts:
- **[Azerty Extended](stk-zqsd/readme.md)**	- _The native French azerty keyboard, but with more key combos._
- **[French Qwerty](stk-wasd/readme.md)**	- _The same, but with WASD control keys instead of ZQSD_
- **[Qwazerty Hybrid](stk-hybrid/readme.md)**	- _An unstable layout that can be either Azerty or Qwerty depending on the context.._
