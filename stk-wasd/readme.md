# French Qwerty Extended

An almost exact replica of the native French Azerty layout, but with the `WASD` and `ZQSD` key-sets swapped around.

Also contains all the extra keys combo from my [Extended Azerty](../stk-zqsd/readme.md) layout.

## Why ?

The intent for this layout is to provide the Gaming advantages of a Qwerty layout, all whilst preserving the Azerty typewriting experience.

A majority of video-games do not provide proper key-rebinding options, (sometimes none at all). Even when they do have such options, they are often still incomplete, and certain controls remain bound to keys that only make sense on a Qwerty layout. Thus the only viable way to play such games is switching to a Qwerty layout with Alt+Shift.

When such games also happen to require typewriting (e.g: in-game chat), it becomes a bit more complicated : 1) we are so used to the Azerty layout, we don't know where the keys go on the Qwerty layout, 2) the physical keyboard under our fingers still has the paintjob of an Azerty layout, so we can't just look down in order to find the key.

Juggling with keyboard layouts is an integral aspect of the French gaming experience.
